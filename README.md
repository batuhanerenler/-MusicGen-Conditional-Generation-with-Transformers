# -MusicGen-Conditional-Generation-with-Transformers
This project demonstrates how to use the transformers library to generate music conditionally using the MusicgenForConditionalGeneration model. The script provides a step-by-step guide to load the model, generate music based on a text description, and handle various issues such as float precision, chunked generation, and silence detection.
